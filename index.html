            <h1>Chicken Recipe</h1>
            <p>This sauce not only tastes amazing, it’s incredible satisfying watching it bubble and morph into a perfectly balanced savoury, sweet and garlicky syrup. But your mouth really begins to water watching the sauce simmer all around your chicken and coat it so effortlessly. The bonus of this recipe? It makes up so much sauce that you have enough to drizzle to over some rice or steamed broccoli.</p>
            <h2>chicken thighs or breats?</h2>
            <p>Chicken thighs are perfect for this recipe, since dark meat is super moist and packed full of flavour. Although, we also love this recipe with chicken breasts… they are incredible in this sauce.</p>
            <p>The best part about this Honey Garlic Chicken? You have ALL the ingredients in your kitchen pantry/kitchen tap/refrigerator already.</p>
